zf-simple-auth
==============

A minimalistic authentication module.

I use this module when i need to test my developments in authenticated mode with ZendSkeletonApplication.

Not for use in production, but useful in dev.

It provides a form to log in and out.
Initially used for testing ZfcRbac, the identity is provided with simples roles.

Installation
============

* Add dependency in your composer.json
* Add 'ZfSimpleAuth' in application.config.php
