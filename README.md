zf-simple-auth
==============

[![Master Branch Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jmleroux/zf-simple-auth.png?branch=master)]
(http://travis-ci.org/jmleroux/zf-simple-auth)

A minimalistic authentication module.

I use this module when i need to test my developments in authenticated mode with ZendSkeletonApplication.

Not for use in production, but useful in dev.

It provides a form to log in and out with a basic ZendSkeletonApplication.

Initially used for testing ZfcRbac, the identity is provided with simples roles.
